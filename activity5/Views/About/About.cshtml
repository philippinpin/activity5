            <p>
                Hi, I’m Philip, a third-year Computer Engineering student at Angeles University Foundation. I have a strong passion for technology, with a focus on software development, hardware design, and systems architecture. Throughout my studies, I’ve gained experience in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, and have worked on projects involving web development, embedded systems, and AI.

                I’m always eager to learn and grow, participating in hackathons and internships to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I aim to combine my technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

                Feel free to check out my portfolio to see my work!
